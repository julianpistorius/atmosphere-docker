# Atmosphere-Docker

Entire Atmosphere development environment in Docker Containers using Docker-Compose.

**Please note that this is a work in progress. It currently works to deploy a local Atmosphere setup, but more work is required to harness the full potential of Docker Compose. Create issues for any problems or feature requests.**

**Also, take a look at the open issues to see what you can expect to go wrong**

For development purposes, use [atmosphere-docker-dev](https://github.com/cyverse/atmosphere-docker-dev).


## Getting started
1. `docker-compose build` to build all containers. This step will take a while the first time it is run, but will be quicker after that
    - Optionally change repositories and branches by modifying the `docker-compose.yml` file
    - To populate with an existing database, copy the `.sql` file to the `postgres` directory before building
2. Copy `secrets.env.example` to `secrets.env` and fill it out with the `atmosphere-docker-secrets` repository link and an SSH private key that has access to this repository
    - You can get your private key in the correct format with this command: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | awk 'ORS="\\n"'`
3. `docker-compose up` to start all containers (use the `-d` option to start containers in the background)


### Tips
Gracefully shut down containers with `Ctrl+c`. Press it again to kill containers.

Or kill all containers with `docker-compose kill`.

Delete all containers when you are done with `docker-compose rm`.

Delete all unattached volumes with `docker volume prune`.

**NOTE:** When the `logs/` directory is created by Docker Compose it will be owned by root so you cannot delete it without `sudo`. However, `rm -rf logs` will delete all of the files but the directory structure will remain. If you create the logs directory before running the containers, you can easily delete it.
